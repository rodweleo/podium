# Podium

Podium is a social media platform designed with a focus on inclusivity, robust content moderation, and creating a safe environment for both content creators and consumers. This README file provides an overview of the project, including its purpose, features, and the technologies used in its development.

## Purpose

The primary goal of Podium is to address the growing concerns around inclusivity and safety in social media platforms. By implementing advanced content moderation techniques and fostering a community-driven approach, Podium aims to create a welcoming space where users from diverse backgrounds can engage with each other without fear of harassment or discrimination.

## Features

- **Inclusivity**: Podium encourages users to express themselves freely while respecting the boundaries of others. Features such as customizable privacy settings and content filters empower users to curate their online experience according to their preferences.
- **Content Moderation**: Leveraging advanced AI algorithms powered by the Gemini API, Podium automatically detects and filters out harmful or inappropriate content, ensuring that the platform remains safe and welcoming for all users.
- **Safe Environment**: Podium prioritizes the safety and well-being of its users by providing robust reporting tools, proactive moderation, and community guidelines enforcement. Users can feel confident that their interactions on Podium are protected and monitored to maintain a positive atmosphere.

## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**: Podium's frontend is built using ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture allows for efficient development and seamless user interactions.
- **Gemini API**: Podium integrates with the Gemini API for advanced content moderation capabilities. By leveraging machine learning and natural language processing, Gemini helps identify and filter out harmful content in real-time.
- **Firebase**: Podium utilizes Firebase as its backend infrastructure, providing authentication, data storage, and real-time database capabilities. Firebase's scalable and reliable platform ensures smooth performance and seamless user experiences.
- **NodeJS**: Podium's server-side logic is implemented using NodeJS, a lightweight and efficient JavaScript runtime. NodeJS enables rapid development of backend services, handling tasks such as user authentication, API integrations, and data processing.
